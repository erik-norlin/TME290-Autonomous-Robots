# TME290-Autonomous-Robots
Main objectives here has been to learn fundamental principals and practices within robotics and software engineering such as implementing and simulating the Kalman filter, behaviour based robotics and kinematic differentially steered robots in microservices using Linux, Docker, C++, Python, Git and CI+CD. A group project was also carried out where we programmed a [Kiwi car](https://github.com/chalmers-revere/opendlv-tutorial-kiwi) to autonomously complete a set of isolated different tasks such as driving through a cone track, finding post it notes then parking on them, and detecting other Kiwi cars and then start following them. The group project can be found [here](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/tme290/2023/group4).
