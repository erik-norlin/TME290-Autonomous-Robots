# TME290-Autonomous-Robots
The main objectives here have been to implement and simulate fundamental principals within robotics such as the Kalman filter, behavior based robotics and kinematic differentially steered robots. These concepts were implemented using important and common software engineering tools and practices such as microservices, Linux, Docker, C++, Python, Git and CI+CD. A group project was also carried out where we programmed a [Kiwi car](https://github.com/chalmers-revere/opendlv-tutorial-kiwi) to autonomously complete a set of different isolated tasks where it could drive through a cone track, find post it notes then park on them, and detect other Kiwi cars then start following them. The group project can be found [here](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/tme290/2023/group4).
